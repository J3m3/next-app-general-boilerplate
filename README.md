# CSS Variations

It also contains [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting, and [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx/tree/master) & [cva](https://cva.style/docs) utilities for component styling.

# Note

This boilerplate uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. Here's some "npx" equivalents for pnpm.

```bash
# Running executables inside your downloaded dependencies
npx eslint --fix file.ts
pnpm exec eslint --fix file.ts

# Running executable commands in packages you want to download transiently
npx storybook@latest init
pnpm dlx storybook@latest init
```
